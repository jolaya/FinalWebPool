        <h3>Rules of the Irish Pool society @ NCI</h3>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>To pot all of one set of colours finishing on potting the black ball</p>
        <h4>Basic Rules (Setup /break)</h4>
        <p>
            Players are allowed to bring their own pool cues should they so wish.
            White ball is placed in semi-circle at beginning (baulk end of the table). First shot can be taken from anywhere inside semicircle. This initial shot is called the break.
            The Colours as place as illustrated in the triangle and the lower end of the table.
            A coin shall be tossed with the winner of heads and tails to break first.
        </p>

        </div>
         <h4>
            The game (from break)
        </h4> 
        <p>
            If the player pots any colour ball (red or yellow), that player is declared on reds or on yellows.
            In a case when a player pots a ball(s) from each colour set from the break, that player can choose which colour to declare him/herself on.
            Should no ball be potted from the break the other player is free to pot either colour and taken in turns, a single shot at a time until a colour has been potted.
            Should a player pot the white ball, the white ball is retrieved by the opponent and placed anywhere in the semi-circle at the baulk end of table. This player is entitled to two consecutive shots.
            No back table is permitted on any colour from a potted an opponent’s white ball.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Minor Fouls
        </h4>
        <p>
            <b>Two shots are given to the opponent in the following scenarios;</b>
            Hit the wrong colour first.
            Pot the white
            Knock the white ball off the table.
            Don’t hit any ball with the white ball
            Push the white with the cue rather than a cue action.
            A player accidentally or purposely interferes (displaces) any of the pool balls of any colour.

        </p>
        <h4>
            Major Fouls (causes Forfeits)
        </h4>
        <p>
            3 minor fouls.
            A black ball is potted by a player who still has their prospective colour(s) remaining.
            The black ball is potted when a player didn’t name their pocket.

        </p>
        <h4>
            The Freeball rule
        </h4>
        <p> If a player snookers another player (ie they can’t hit their prospective colour) in a shot in which they committed a minor foul then the opponent is entitled to a free ball. This means they can hit any ball they want for that shot.
Freeball  when a player is on a colour entitles that player to two shots in total (one of which is freeball to get out of the snooker).
Freeball when a player is on the black entitles them to only one shot in total.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Code of conduct
        </h4>
        <p>
            No taunting of any kind is permitted.
            Standing over an opponent’s pocket eye line is not permitted.
            Standing in an opponent’s way is not permitted.
            No disruptive noise is permitted during shots.
            While snacking and drinking is permitted in the venue, none is permitted at the pool tables.
            At least one foot must be on the ground at all times when taking a shot.
